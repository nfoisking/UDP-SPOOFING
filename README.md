# <i>UDP Spoofing Example (Educational Purposes)</i>

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to create and send spoofed UDP packets using the Scapy library. The script is designed to help users understand the basics of UDP packet construction, the concept of IP spoofing, and the process of sending network packets.

> <b>Note:</b> This code is for <i>educational purposes only</i>. Unauthorized use of packet spoofing can be illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have proper authorization to test network security.

## <b>Overview</b>

<i>UDP</i> (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol used in network communication. Unlike TCP, UDP does not establish a connection before sending data, making it lightweight and faster but less reliable. This script demonstrates <b><i>UDP packet spoofing</i></b>, where a packet is sent with a falsified source IP address.

The goal of this project is to teach how UDP packets are structured and how spoofing works in a controlled environment for educational purposes.

## <b>Requirements</b>

- Python 3.x
- [Scapy](https://scapy.net/), a powerful Python-based tool for network packet manipulation.

You can install the required library by running:
```pip install scrappy```

<b>Example Configuration:</b>
ip_src: Spoofed source IP address.
ip_dst: Target destination IP address.
src_port: Source port number (random or specified).
dst_port: Destination port number (e.g., 53 for DNS).
payload: The data to include in the UDP packet (could be any message).

## <b>Installation</b>
git clone https://github.com/nfoisking/UDP-SPOOFING
cd UDP-SPOOOFING
